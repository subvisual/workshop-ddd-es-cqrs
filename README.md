# ES/CQRS Workshop

## Intro

Hello, my name is [Ronaldo](http://github.com/ronaldofs) and I'm a software designer and developer, proud dad and guitarist wannabe.
I work @ [Subvisual](https://subvisual.com) where we focus on helping ventures jumpstart or scale their business, be it strategy or hands-on, currently collaborating on several projects in web3/blockchain space.

## Overview

In this workshop, we'll build a backend application in Elixir where the main goal is to showcase and discuss Event Sourcing and CQRS in the context of "real-world" business problems.

We'll cover strategy, planning and specification for a selected and scoped business domain and analyse implementation patterns and trade-offs for each component of the final solution.

**Topics covered:**

- Domain-driven Design
  - Domain/subdomain
  - Ubiquitous language
  - Bounded context
  - Continuous collaboration
  - Tactical patterns
- Event Sourcing and CQRS
  - CRUD
  - Events and Streams
  - Event Store
  - Projection
  - Process manager / Saga
- Collaborative modeling
  - Event Storming
  - Event Modeling
  - Context Mapping
  - User Story Mapping
  - Value Stream Mapping
- Process
  - Delivery vs Discovery
